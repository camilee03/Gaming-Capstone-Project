The following is a list of objects, their character identifier, and their respective properties (Properties are shown as P):

    Box: b (P: none)
    Button: B (P: none)
    Clothes: x (P: plentiful)
    Chair: C (P: paired[Table])
    Coal: c (P: paired[Furnace], plentiful)
    EnergyCore: e (P: paired[Button])
    Fan: F (P: scarce)
    Food: X (P: paired[Table])
    Furnace: f (P: paired[Coal], scarce)
    Lever: l (P: none)
    Light: L (P: plentiful, essential)
    Paper: p (P: plentiful)
    Table: t (P: scarce, paired[Chair])
    Terminal: T (P: essential, scarce)
    Radio: r (P: none)
    Wires: w (P: none)
    Vent: v (P: none)
    WashingMachineChute: W (P: paired[Clothes])
    Trash: z (P: plentiful)


Property Definitions:
    - Essential: Must be included in each room.
    - Scarce: 0-1 of these objects can be included.
    - Plentiful: If included, at least one more of this type will be included later.
    - Paired: If included, the object in brackets must also be included.
    - None: Has no other properties


For each of the room types, please create a list of objects that would make sense present in the room. 
Each object must align both to its properties and the theming of the room. Each room should have no more 
than 10 objects in it with no object repeating more than once. This list will only act as objects that make
sense in the room, not necessarily how many there will be. 

The following is an example of some of the rooms showing how the format should be returned (files should be returned as a json):
{"Fuel Storage": ['c', 'f', 'l', 'e', 'B', 'b', 'L', 'T'], "Supply Room": ['C', 't', 'v', 'b', 'L', 'T'], "Intelligence Room": ['v', 't', 'b', 'L', 'T']}
